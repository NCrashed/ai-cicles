I want you to output Rust code. The program is a game that renders with SDL2 library. The player is small red circle that can be moved by WASD input by player. There are blue circles that are moving with constant speed and bounces off screen border and each other. If player touches the blue circle, player is moved to the center of the screen. There are 10 randomly generated blue circles on the start.
